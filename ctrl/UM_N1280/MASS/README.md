# ctrl for retrieving filed from MASS

Each file in here is a simple config, that is turned into a MASS query and then executred to retrive the defined data from MASS. e.g.

* `cosmic-retrieve-from-mass u-ak543_ap9_precip.py`
    * retrieves all files defined in `u-ak543_ap9_precip.py`

There are some differences between which precip variables are defined for each suite. See `common.py` for a list of what these are.
